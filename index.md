# modeltime

> Tidy time series forecasting in `R`.

Mission: Our number 1 goal is to make high-performance time series
analysis easier, faster, and more scalable. Modeltime solves this with a
simple to use infrastructure for modeling and forecasting time series.

## Quickstart Video

For those that prefer video tutorials, we have an [11-minute YouTube
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bCelif-ENY) that walks you
through the Modeltime Workflow.

## Tutorials

- [**Getting Started with
  Modeltime**](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html):
  A walkthrough of the 6-Step Process for using `modeltime` to forecast

- [**Modeltime
  Documentation**](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/): Learn
  how to **use** `modeltime`, **find** *Modeltime Models*, and
  **extend** `modeltime` so you can use new algorithms inside the
  *Modeltime Workflow*.

## Installation

CRAN version:

``` r
install.packages("modeltime", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Why modeltime?

> Modeltime unlocks time series models and machine learning in one
> framework

![](articles/forecast_plot.jpg)

No need to switch back and forth between various frameworks. `modeltime`
unlocks machine learning & classical time series analysis.

- **forecast**: Use ARIMA, ETS, and more models coming
  ([`arima_reg()`](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/reference/arima_reg.md),
  [`arima_boost()`](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/reference/arima_boost.md),
  &
  [`exp_smoothing()`](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/reference/exp_smoothing.md)).
- **prophet**: Use Facebook’s Prophet algorithm
  ([`prophet_reg()`](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/reference/prophet_reg.md)
  &
  [`prophet_boost()`](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/reference/prophet_boost.md))
- **tidymodels**: Use any `parsnip` model: `rand_forest()`,
  `boost_tree()`, `linear_reg()`, `mars()`, `svm_rbf()` to forecast

## Forecast faster

> A streamlined workflow for forecasting

Modeltime incorporates a [streamlined workflow (see Getting Started with
Modeltime)](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html)
for using best practices to forecast.

## Summary

Modeltime is an amazing ecosystem for time series forecasting. But it
can take a long time to learn:

- Many algorithms
- Ensembling and Resampling
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Scalable Modeling: 10,000+ time series

Your probably thinking how am I ever going to learn time series
forecasting. Here’s the solution that will save you years of struggling.

## Take the High-Performance Forecasting Course

> Become the forecasting expert for your organization

[![High-Performance Time Series Forecasting
Course](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/bKyqVAi5Qi64sS05QYLk)](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/)

[*High-Performance Time Series
Course*](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. **Businesses now need 10,000+ time series
forecasts every day.** This is what I call a *High-Performance Time
Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)* - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable
Forecasting.

**High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving
accuracy and scalability.** Imagine what will happen to your career if
you can provide your organization a “High-Performance Time Series
Forecasting System” (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my [**High-Performance Time
Series Forecasting
Course**](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting).
You will learn:
