\usage{
modeltime_nested_forecast(
  object,
  h = NULL,
  include_actual = TRUE,
  conf_interval = 0.95,
  id = NULL,
  control = control_nested_forecast()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Nested Modeltime Table}

\item{h}{The forecast horizon. Extends the "trained on" data "h" periods
into the future.}

\item{include_actual}{Whether or not to include the ".actual_data" as part of the forecast.
If FALSE, just returns the forecast predictions.}

\item{conf_interval}{An estimated confidence interval based on the calibration data.
This is designed to estimate future confidence from \emph{out-of-sample prediction error}.}

\item{id}{A sequence of ID's from the modeltime table to subset the forecasting process.
This can speed forecasts up.}

\item{control}{Used to control verbosity and parallel processing. See \code{\link[=control_nested_forecast]{control_nested_forecast()}}.}
}
\description{
Make a new forecast from a Nested Modeltime Table.
}
\details{
This function is designed to help users that want to make new forecasts other than those
that are created during the logging process as part of the Nested Modeltime Workflow.
\subsection{Logged Forecasts}{

The logged forecasts can be extracted using:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=extract_nested_future_forecast]{extract_nested_future_forecast()}}: Extracts the future forecast created after refitting with \code{modeltime_nested_refit()}.
\item \code{\link[=extract_nested_test_forecast]{extract_nested_test_forecast()}}: Extracts the test forecast created after initial fitting with \code{modeltime_nested_fit()}.
}

The problem is that these forecasts are static. The user would need to redo the fitting, model selection,
and refitting process to obtain new forecasts. This is why \code{modeltime_nested_forecast()} exists. So you can create
a new forecast without retraining any models.
}

\subsection{Nested Forecasts}{

The main arguments is
\code{h}, which is a horizon that specifies how far into the future to make the new forecast.
\itemize{
\item If \code{h = NULL}, a logged forecast will be returned
\item If \code{h = 12}, a new forecast will be generated that extends each series 12-periods into the future.
\item If \code{h = "2 years"}, a new forecast will be generated that extends each series 2-years into the future.
}

Use the \code{id} to filter the Nested Modeltime Table \code{object} to just the time series of interest.
Note that this will have no effect if \code{h = NULL} as logged forecasts are returned.

Use the \code{conf_interval} to override the logged confidence interval.
Note that this will have no effect if \code{h = NULL} as logged forecasts are returned.
So be sure to provide \code{h} if you want to update the confidence interval.

Use the \code{control} argument to apply verbosity during the forecasting process and to run forecasts in parallel.
Generally, parallel is better if many forecasts are being generated.
