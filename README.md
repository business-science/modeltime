## Features & Benefits

#### Modeltime unlocks time series models and machine learning in 1 framework

No need to switch back and forth between various frameworks. `modeltime`
unlocks machine learning & classical time series analysis.

  - `forecast`: Use ARIMA, ETS, and more models coming.
  - `prophet`: Use Facebook’s `prophet()` algorithm
  - `tidymodels`: Use any `parsnip` model: `rand_forest()`, Boosted
    `boost_tree()`, `linear_reg()`, `mars()`, `svm_rbf()` to forecast

#### A streamlined workflow for forecasting

Modeltime incorporates a [simple workflow (see Getting Started with
Modeltime)](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html)
for using best practices to forecast.

#### Interactive plotting by default

All plots incorporate both `plotly` (interactive) and `ggplot2` (static)
visualizations. This means you can quickly add forecasts to `shiny`
apps, `rmarkdown` documents, and more.
