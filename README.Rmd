The time series forecasting package for the `tidymodels` ecosystem. 




## Tutorials

- [__Getting Started with Modeltime__](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html): A walkthrough of the 6-Step Process for using `modeltime` to forecast

- [__Modeltime Documentation__](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/): Learn how to __use__ `modeltime`, __find__ _Modeltime Models_, and __extend__ `modeltime` so you can use new algorithms inside the _Modeltime Workflow_. 



## Installation

CRAN version:

``` r
install.packages("modeltime")
```

Development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime")
```

## Why modeltime?


> Modeltime unlocks time series models and machine learning in one framework 

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/forecast_plot.jpg")
```

No need to switch back and forth between various frameworks. `modeltime` unlocks machine learning & classical time series analysis.

  - __forecast__: Use ARIMA, ETS, and more models coming (`arima_reg()`, `arima_boost()`, & `exp_smoothing()`). 
  - __prophet__: Use Facebook's Prophet algorithm (`prophet_reg()` & `prophet_boost()`)
  - __tidymodels__: Use any `parsnip` model: `rand_forest()`, `boost_tree()`, `linear_reg()`, `mars()`, `svm_rbf()` to forecast 

## Forecast faster

> A streamlined workflow for forecasting

Modeltime incorporates a [streamlined workflow (see Getting Started with Modeltime)](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html) for using best practices to forecast.

## Meet the modeltime ecosystem 

> Learn a growing ecosystem of forecasting packages

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="The modeltime ecosystem is growing"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/modeltime_ecosystem.jpg")
```

Modeltime is part of a __growing ecosystem__ of Modeltime forecasting packages.

[_High-Performance Time Series Course_](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. __Businesses now need 10,000+ time series forecasts every day.__ This is what I call a _High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)_ - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable Forecasting. 

 __High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving accuracy and scalability.__ Imagine what will happen to your career if you can provide your organization a "High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System" (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my [__High-Performance Time Series Forecasting Course__](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting). You will learn:

- __Time Series Machine Learning__ (cutting-edge) with `Modeltime` - 30+ Models (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest, & many more)
- __Deep Learning__ with `GluonTS` (Competition Winners)
- __Time Series Preprocessing__, Noise Reduction, & Anomaly Detection
- __Feature engineering__ using lagged variables & external regressors
- __Hyperparameter Tuning__
- __Time series cross-validation__
- __Ensembling__ Multiple Machine Learning & Univariate Modeling Techniques (Competition Winner)
- __Scalable Forecasting__ - Forecast 1000+ time series in parallel
- and more.
